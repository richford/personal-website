My favorite activity is growing up all over again with my daughter, Ida.

I'm also a (less) dedicated father to our aging furbaby, Mousse.

### Peace Corps

From 2011-2013, I served as a [U.S. Peace
Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/) volunteer in the Kingdom of
Morocco. I lived with my partner in a Berber town in the
Ouarzazate Province. Our projects spanned health infrastructure -- we
built bathrooms at the local school -- and education -- we started a
peer education program to help local high school students teach their
peers about health and HIV/AIDS. I also worked with other volunteers to
organize the country's first national English spelling bee competition.

My friend, Drew, came to visit me and took beautiful photos
while he was there. If you'd like to see photos of where we
lived, check out

### Outdoors

I love spending time outdoors when I get a chance. I enjoy rock
climbing, mountaineering, and backpacking (both solo and with
friends and family). I've volunteered from time to time with the
Seattle-based outdoor education nonprofit [Cascase Leadership
Challenge](http://cascadechallenge.org/), organizing group climbs
on Mt. Hood, Mt. Baker, and Mt. St. Helens. If you'd like to support
a Seattle-based youth outdoor leadership program, consider donating.

### Marine Mammal Care

Once upon a time, I volunteered extensively at the [Marine Mammal Care
Center](https://marinemammalcarecenterlosangeles.com/) in San Pedro,
CA, where I nurtured and rehabilitated sick and injured seals and sea
lions. It was a long time ago but it was a formative experience. Check
out their site for lots of cute seal and sea lion pics and videos. And
donate while you're there.
