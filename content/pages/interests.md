My favorite activity is growing up all over again with my daughter, Ida.

I'm also a (slightly less) dedicated father to our furbaby, Mousse.

### Peace Corps

From 2011-2013, I served as a
<a href="https://www.peacecorps.gov/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">
  U.S. Peace Corps
</a>
volunteer in the Kingdom of
Morocco. I lived with my partner in a Berber town in the
Ouarzazate Province. Our projects spanned health infrastructure -- we
built bathrooms at the local school -- and education -- we started a
peer education program to help local high school students teach their
peers about health and HIV/AIDS. I also worked with other volunteers to
organize the country's first national English spelling bee competition.

My friend, Drew, came to visit me and took beautiful photos
while he was there. If you'd like to see photos of where we
lived, check out

### Outdoors

I love spending time outdoors when I get a chance. I enjoy rock
climbing, mountaineering, and backpacking (both solo and with
friends and family). I've volunteered from time to time with the
Seattle-based outdoor education nonprofit

  Cascade Leadership Challenge

climbs on Mt. Hood, Mt. Baker, and Mt. St. Helens. Consider

### Marine Mammal Care

When I lived in Los Angeles, I volunteered extensively at the
<a href="https://marinemammalcarecenterlosangeles.com/"

  Marine Mammal Care Center
</a>
in San Pedro, CA, where I nurtured and rehabilitated sick and injured
seals and sea lions. It was a long time ago but it was a formative
experience. Check out their site for lots of cute seal and sea lion pics
and videos. And
