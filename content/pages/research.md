### Neuroscience

My current research interests lie at the nexus of neuroimaging and
data science. I focus on developing statistical techniques and
software for the analysis of diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, which is situated
within the paradigm of Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ). See
[autofq.org](autofq.org) for further documentation of our projects. I am
supervised by [Ariel Rokem](arokem.org) and collaborate with
[Noah Simon](https://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/),
[Jason Yeatman](https://www.brainandeducation.com/), and
[Anisha Keshavan](https://anisha.pizza/), among others.

### Physics

Before transitioning to neuroscience, I pursued
physics, earning my PhD under the supervision of [Aurel
Bulgac](https://faculty.washington.edu/bulgac/) at the University of
Washington. My research focused on sign-problem avoidance techniques in
auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, with applications to
the BCS-BEC crossover and infinite neutron matter. I was fortunate to
collaborate with
[Joaqu&iacute;n Drut](https://users.physics.unc.edu/~drut/public_html_UNC/index.html)
[Jeremy Holt](http://www.quantumnovae.com/),
[Kenneth Roche](http://users.nccs.gov/~roche/),
and
[Gabriel Wlaz&#0322;owski](http://www.if.pw.edu.pl/~gabrielw/). 

Before that, I earned my MS in physics under the supervision of
[Andreas Bill](https://web.csulb.edu/depts/physics/people/bill_a.shtml)
at [California State University, Long
Beach](https://www.csulb.edu/physics-astronomy). My research there
focused on modeling the coexistence of superconductivity and
magnetism in heterogeneous structures composed of superconducting and
ferromagnetic layers.

I was a visiting researcher for about six months at NASA's [Jet
Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). Under the supervision
of [John
Armstrong](https://scienceandtechnology.jpl.nasa.gov/people/j_armstrong),
we demonstrated a new radio science application for spacecraft
navigation signals.
<!---
Guidance engineers use the Doppler shift of these signals to
verify spacecraft trajectory. We realized that the uplink and downlink
irregularities — what guidance engineers would call “noise” —
held information about the near-Sun plasma environment. We exploited
the differing transfer functions of these irregularities to localize
solar plasma scattering along the line-of-sight, proving a new method to
monitor solar activity. Using Cassini spacecraft data, we demonstrated
that this technique could determine scattering position to spatial
scales well below that of other techniques.

### Computing

Computational science is the theme uniting my work in both physics and
neuroscience. Here are some of my research computing activities not
captured in the domain-specific sections above:

##### The Carpentries

I volunteer as an instructor with [The
Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) (which comprises
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data
Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/)). I help teach shell scripting,
introductory python, and principles of version control in 2-4 day
workshops hosted by the eScience Institute at the University of
Washington.

If you'd like to learn basic lab skills for research computing,
you should definitely attend one of the upcoming [carpentries
workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) or contact me if you'd
like help in requesting a workshop at your institution.

##### Cloudknot

With [Ariel Rokem](arokem.org), we developed a python library
called Cloudknot ([docs](https://nrdg.github.io/cloudknot/), 
[github](https://github.com/nrdg/cloudknot)) that helps researchers run
their existing code on [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/).

##### UW Research Computing Club

As my PhD research became more and more computationally
intensive, I helped start the [UW Research Computing
Club](https://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/). I served as a founding
officer and the president of the club, which facilitates access to
and training for UW’s shared supercomputing cluster, Hyak. The club
manages over one million dollars in computing resources, both on Hyak
and in the cloud. It provides access to these resources and training
to students to use them effectively and responsibly. To my knowledge,
it is the only student-run club in the nation that provides access to
supercomputing resources to all undergraduate and graduate students on
its campus, regardless of lab affiliation. After serving as president
of the club, I then served on the [Hyak Governance
Board](http://www.int.washington.edu/users/mjs5/HYAK/governance/), which
advises the leadership of UW on how best to meet the high performance
computing needs of UW researchers.
