### Neuroscience, Education, and Data Science

My current research interests lie at the nexus of neuroimaging and
data science. I focus on developing statistical techniques and
software for the analysis of diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, which is situated
within the paradigm of Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ). See
<a href="autofq.org"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">autofq.org</a>
for further documentation of our projects. I also develop browser based tools
for the deep phenotyping of dyslexia. I am supervised by
<a href="https://www.brainandeducation.com/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Yeatman</a>,
and collaborate with
<a href="arokem.org"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Rokem</a> and
<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Noah Simon</a>, among many others.

### Physics

Before transitioning to neuroscience, I pursued
physics, earning my PhD under the supervision of
<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/bulgac/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Aurel Bulgac</a>
at the University of Washington. My research focused on sign-problem
avoidance techniques in auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations,
with applications to the BCS-BEC crossover and infinite neutron matter.
I was fortunate to collaborate with
<a href="https://users.physics.unc.edu/~drut/public_html_UNC/index.html"
   target="_blank"

<a href="http://users.nccs.gov/~roche/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenneth Roche</a>, and
<a href="http://www.if.pw.edu.pl/~gabrielw/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabriel Wlaz&#0322;owski</a>. 

Before that, I earned my MS in physics under the supervision of
<a href="https://web.csulb.edu/depts/physics/people/bill_a.shtml"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Andreas Bill</a> at 
<a href="https://www.csulb.edu/physics-astronomy"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">California State University, Long Beach</a>.
My research there focused on modeling the coexistence of
superconductivity and magnetism in heterogeneous structures composed of
superconducting and ferromagnetic layers.

I was a visiting researcher for about six months at NASA's
<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>.
Under the supervision of
<a href="https://scienceandtechnology.jpl.nasa.gov/people/j_armstrong"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">John Armstrong</a>,
we demonstrated a new radio science application for spacecraft
navigation signals.
<!---
Guidance engineers use the Doppler shift of these signals to
verify spacecraft trajectory. We realized that the uplink and downlink
irregularities — what guidance engineers would call “noise” —
held information about the near-Sun plasma environment. We exploited
the differing transfer functions of these irregularities to localize
solar plasma scattering along the line-of-sight, proving a new method to
monitor solar activity. Using Cassini spacecraft data, we demonstrated
that this technique could determine scattering position to spatial
scales well below that of other techniques.

### Computing

Computational science is the theme uniting my work in both physics and
neuroscience. Here are some of my research computing activities not
captured in the domain-specific sections above:

##### The Carpentries

I volunteer as an instructor with
<a href="https://carpentries.org/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">The Carpentries</a>
(which comprises
<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Carpentry</a>
and
<a href="https://datacarpentry.org/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Carpentry</a>).
I help teach shell scripting, introductory python, and principles of
version control in 2-4 day workshops hosted by the eScience Institute at
the University of Washington.

If you'd like to learn basic lab skills for research computing, you
should definitely attend one of the upcoming
<a href="https://carpentries.org/workshops/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">carpentries workshops</a>
or contact me if you'd like help in requesting a workshop at your
institution.

##### Cloudknot

With 
<a href="arokem.org"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Rokem</a>,
we developed a python library
called Cloudknot
(<a href="https://nrdg.github.io/cloudknot/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/nrdg/cloudknot"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>)
that helps researchers run eir existing code on
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/batch/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Batch</a>.

##### UW Research Computing Club

As my PhD research became more and more computationally
intensive, I helped start the
<a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">UW Research Computing Club</a>.
I served as a founding officer and the president of the club, which
facilitates access to and training for UW’s shared supercomputing
cluster, Hyak. The club manages over one million dollars in computing
resources, both on Hyak and in the cloud. It provides access to
these resources and training to students to use them effectively and
responsibly. To my knowledge, it is the only student-run club in
the nation that provides access to supercomputing resources to all
undergraduate and graduate students on its campus, regardless of lab
affiliation. After serving as president of the club, I then served on
the
<a href="http://www.int.washington.edu/users/mjs5/HYAK/governance/"
   target="_blank"
   rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyak Governance Board</a>,
which advises the leadership of UW on how best to meet the high
performance computing needs of UW researchers.
