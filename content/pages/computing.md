### The Carpentries

I volunteer as an instructor with [The
Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) (which comprises
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data
Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/)). I help teach shell scripting,
introductory python, and principles of version control in 2-4 day
workshops hosted by the eScience Institute at the University of
Washington.

If you'd like to learn basic lab skills for research computing,
you should definitely attend one of the upcoming [carpentries
workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) or contact me if you'd
like help in requesting a workshop at your institution.

### UW HPC Club

As my PhD research became more and more computationally intensive,
I helped start the [UW High Performance Computing (HPC)
Club](http://students.washington.edu/hpcc/). I served as a founding
officer and the president of the club, which facilitates access to and
training for UWâ€™s shared supercomputing cluster, Hyak. The HPC Club
manages over one million dollars in computing resources, both on Hyak
and in the cloud. It provides access to these resources and training
to students to use them effectively and responsibly. To my knowledge,
it is the only student-run club in the nation that provides access to
supercomputing resources to all undergraduate and graduate students on
its campus, regardless of lab affiliation. After serving as president
of the club, I represented student interests on the [Hyak Governance
Board](http://www.int.washington.edu/users/mjs5/HYAK/governance/),
which advises the leadership of UW on how best to meet the HPC needs of
researchers at UW.
